# Interactive-Scheduler

The Interactive Scheduler is a simple, intuitive tool designed to help users manage their time efficiently during standard business hours. By offering a clear visual representation of the day's schedule, the planner allows users to add, view, and save events with ease.

Features
Current Day Display: Upon opening the planner, users are greeted with the current day displayed prominently at the top of the calendar, ensuring they are always planning for the right date.

Time Blocks for Business Hours: The planner provides time blocks that span standard business hours from 9 AM to 5 PM. This structure helps users organize their workday efficiently.

Color-Coded Time Blocks: Each time block is color-coded to visually represent whether it is in the past (gray), the present (red), or the future (green). This color coding allows users to quickly assess their schedule at a glance.

Event Entry: Users can click into any time block to enter an event. This feature allows for detailed planning of tasks and appointments throughout the day.

Local Storage of Events: When an event is added and the save button is clicked, the event text is stored locally on the user's device. This ensures that data is not lost even if the page is refreshed or closed.

Persistent Events: Events saved to local storage will persist when the page is refreshed. Users can revisit the planner at any time to see their scheduled tasks and appointments without needing to re-enter information.

How to Use
Open the Planner: Simply load the planner page to get started. Today's date will be displayed at the top.

Add an Event: Click into the time block for the desired time, then type in your event or task.

Save the Event: Click the save button next to the time block to save your event to local storage.

View and Edit as Needed: Your saved events will be displayed in their respective time blocks, color-coded for past, present, or future. Click into any event to edit it, and save again to update the event in local storage.
